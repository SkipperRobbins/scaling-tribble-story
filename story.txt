There once was a ship that put to sea.
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea.
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down,
Blow, me bully boys, blow.
She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and sore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
