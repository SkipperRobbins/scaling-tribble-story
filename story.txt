There once was a ship that put to sea.
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea.
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down,
Blow, me bully boys, blow.
She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and sore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey)
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go
Before the boad had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands tot he side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below
